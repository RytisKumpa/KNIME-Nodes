        <intro>This node computes the Local Outlier Factor (LOC) for each point in the test data table and helps detect anomalous points. The model stores the training data in memory and uses it to predict the LOC for each point in test data. LOC measures the local deviation of each point with respect to its closest neighbors. A score of ~1 suggests the point is of similar density as its neighbors. A larger score would suggest the point is an outlier, and a lower score would suggest the point is of higher density than its neighbors.</intro>
